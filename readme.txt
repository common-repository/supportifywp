= Multisite supported? =

Yes of course.

= Your templates does not work properly with my theme, how can I solve this? =

Basically the plugin does not sue your themes's page templates, which is necessary in order to build our custom output. But don't worry, you can easily enhance the HTML markup by adding missing HTML wrappers via plugin settings. If you need assistance finding the right one, just send me message and I would be happy to assist you!
